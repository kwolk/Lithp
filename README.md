After reading a comment online that "Boxing ith a bithneth", I couldn't help myself.

This Safari extension is just a bit of fun of course and will make the web read like it had a speech impediment (Sigmatosis: difficulty in pronouncing sibilant consonants).

The codebase is a crude conversion of the Great English extension from the year before and relies solely on a few simple substitutions:


| normal | lisp |
| -------|------|
| "z"    | "d"
| "c"    | "th"
| "j"    | "dzh"
| "ch"   | "th"


It probably won't do my job prospects any good, but then again I don't work well with wet-the-bed types.

If you want to find offence, you will (I can't believe I need to type this on a place called "Git"). So just don't use it, unless you want to.

Enjoy life :p
